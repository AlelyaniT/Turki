            <h2>Are you curious to know about your motivation and well-being?</h2> 
                 <p>You are in the right place. In this blog, I introduce self-determination theory to explain some of humans motivation and personality.</p> 

                 <p> Self-determination theory(SDT) has been applied into different domains including but not limited to health, education, work and sport. It is an approach to human motivation and personality; it highlights the importance of humans’ resources that could be used to maintain behavior and self-regulation [1,3]. SDT takes a different approach and condition to distinguish between self-determined ”autonomous” versus controlled types of motivation [1].  One of these conditions is the social-contextual condition that facilitates the natural processes of self-motivation and psychological well-being. Individuals whose motivation is self-determined, experience a sense of personal choice and feel their actions represent their true self [5].</p>

                <p> There are three fundamental psychological needs that appeared to be very essential for social development and well-being: competence, autonomy, and relatedness [1]. Satisfaction these three needs lead to improved mental and physical health.  Research studies have shown that individuals whose motivation is not self-determined feel more controlled and pressured [1,4]. Conversely, individuals whose motivation is self-determined experience a sense of personal choice and feel that their actions represent their true self [3]. Furthermore, self-determined motives positively affect behavior engagement [4].</p>

                                         <img src="images/Motivation.jpg"style="width: 600px;" /><br />
                         <br>


                 <p>SDT [2] identified two types of motivations based on different reasons or goals: intrinsic motivation, which refers to doing an activity because it is interesting or enjoyable, and extrinsic motivation, which refers to doing something because it leads to earning a reward or avoiding punishment [3]. Intrinsic motivation results in high-quality learning and creativity; it also shows that people who are intrinsically motivated show more interest and excitement which results in enhanced performance, persistence, and creativity [1,3]. For instance, athletes who go to practice because they find it interesting and want to learn about their sport, or they go to practice for the pleasure of feeling accomplished are considered intrinsically motivated toward the sport activity [6]. Previous research has described three types of intrinsic motivation: intrinsic motivation to know, intrinsic motivation toward accomplishment, and intrinsic motivation to experience stimulation [7].</p>

                 <p>Intrinsic motivation to Know occurs when individuals have the curiosity to explore, learn, and understand [3]. In technology context, individuals are intrinsically motivated to know more about new technology or to discover new ways of using technology to monitor their physical activities. Intrinsic motivation toward accomplishment occurs when engaging in an activity can result in feeling of accomplishment. For instance, individuals who feel a personal satisfaction while they are mastering certain training techniques using any technology tools are intrinsically motivated and would result in enjoyable experience [6]. Intrinsic motivation to experience stimulation occurs when someone engages in the experience for the excitement or enjoyments of being engaged in the activity.</p>
